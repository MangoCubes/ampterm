* Architecture
- This is mostly for me to keep my thoughts in order.
** State Change Management
- Components may have state, and they are marked with Stateful trait
- Drawing should not change state
** Player State Changes
- There are three stages: Idle, Loading and Playing
*** Idle
- Idle -> Loading: When the user selects a music file, and it requires further processing to get the corresponding resource link
- Idle -> Playing: When the user selects a music file, and it does not require further processing because we already have the URL to fetch the music file from
*** Loading
- Loading -> Idle: Playing is cancelled, or the OSClient fails to fetch the link
- Loading -> Playing: The OSClient successfully fetches the link
*** Playing
- Playing -> Idle: Music playing is stopped, or the current music is skipped and the queue is empty
- Playing -> Loading: Current music is skipped and the queue is not empty
